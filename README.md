## Experimental File-to-Video Converter Concept for Cloud Storage
Introducing an experimental endeavor, the File-to-Video Converter Concept for Cloud Storage. This project delves into converting various file formats into videos for potential hosting on cloud video streaming platforms for a theoretical unlimited cloud storage on some platforms. It's crucial to note that this initiative is purely a proof of concept and is not intended for actual deployment.

This project was constructed using C++ with [OpenCV2](https://opencv.org) and [LodePNG](https://lodev.org/lodepng/).

This project idea was initially inspired based off of [Brendan Kirtlan](https://github.com/Brendan-Kirtlan)'s project of a very similar nature which I found in this YouTube [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_w6PCHutmb4).
